###The problem
Itâ€™s a very common task for almost any developer to implement Rest APIs, for each one of them we are following almost the same steps in order to complete the integration, those steps are too long, slow and monotonous .

###Solution
To resolve this problem we are creating a tool to avoid the developers manually implement the steps needed to complete the solution.
Our vision is to provide a Rest API Client Automated Generator that allow the developer to focus in what really matters.
